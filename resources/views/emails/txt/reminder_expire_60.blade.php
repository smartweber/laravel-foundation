It’s almost that time! Yearly Re-Certification needs to be performed on {!! $crt->name !!} {!! $crt->lastname !!} at BK® {!! $crt->restNumber !!} before {!! date("m/d/Y", strtotime("+1 year",$crt->certified_at->getTimestamp())) !!}. 

As a reminder, re-certification process is as follows:

1. ARL & CRT complete sections 1-6 of the CRT Assessment Form. The ARL then enters the results in the CRT Certification Website.
2. MFP reviews the assessment in the CRT Certification Website, confirms Training Restaurant requirements are met, then approves Pre-Certification status if appropriate.
3. MFP visits the CRT at the Training Restaurant to complete section 7 of the CRT Assessment Form for Final (yearly) Certification. MFP enters results into the CRT Certification Website.

If the CRT Certification expires, he/she will not have access to Foundations Trac. This will be your only reminder, Please start the certification process soon!
